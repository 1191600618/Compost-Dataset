# Compost-Dataset
This repository provides access to the dataset used in the research titled.

"Research on the Material and Energy Limits of Aerobic Composting'

The dataset includes 4248 samples collected during the composting process using a dedicated sensor system. 
The content involves over 260 documents from 1993 to 2025, including a total of 4,248 samples of compost from kitchen waste, livestock manure and sludge waste. It contains key environmental features and gas emission data, enabling predictive analysis for compost maturity and monitoring of gas emissions.
Features:
Day: Time since the start of the composting process.
Temperature: Temperature readings (in °C).
MC (%): Moisture content percentage.
pH: Acidity or alkalinity of the compost.
C/N Ratio: Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.
Ammonia (mg/kg): Ammonia concentration in the compost.
Nitrate (mg/kg): Nitrate concentration in the compost.
TN (%):Total nitrogen content.
TOC (%):Total organic carbon content.
EC (ms/cm): Electrical conductivity.
OM (%):Organic matter percentage.
T Value: Transformation value.
GI (%):Germination index percentage.
AN (g/Kg): Ammonium Nitrogen concentration in the compost
NN (g/Kg): Nitrate Nitrogen concentration in the compost
CO2 (g/Kg): CO2 concentration in the compost
CH4 (g/Kg): CH4 concentration in the compost
N2O (g/Kg):N2O concentration in the compost
NH3 (g/Kg): NH3 concentration in the compost
Data Collection: This dataset has been preliminarily collected and organized. Ten datasets were merged after rigorous preprocessing to form this comprehensive dataset. Environmental features such as temperature, C/N ratio, ammonia concentration, pH levels, and nitrate content were analyzed for maturity prediction.

Researchers can use this dataset for:
Developing predictive models for compost maturity.
Monitoring gas emissions during composting.
Implementing interpretable machine learning frameworks for environmental data.
Suggested Tools:
Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LIME, SHAP.
